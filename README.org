* Relatime for the Hurd
This patch adds the 'relatime' and 'strictatime' options to the GNU Hurd.

* What
`relatime' is a filesystem mount option that turns off Unix access time updates unless:
- The file's last access time update was greater than 24 hours ago
- The file's mtime is younger than its atime (mtime > atime)
- The file's ctime is younger than its atime (ctime > atime)

It increases filsystem speed and allows for fewer write cycles to a disk.
